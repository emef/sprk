1. ctx creates a dataset
  a) breaks input into blocks, assigns blocks to executors.
  b) executor forwards block assignment to its workers.
  c) executor forwards block assignment ACK to context.
  d) ??? context waits until ACK received for each block.

solve for (???)

where I'm at now: all messages seem to be hooked up properly, it's a
matter of how the context should handle all the subscriptions and how
to wait on unordered ACKs for the block assigments. We essentially
need the load_dense() function to block until an ACK received for each
assigned block.
