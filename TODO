Status:

  * block assignment interactions seem generally ok for
    now. descriptors are created in the context, then requests sent to
    the broker which load balances across the executors. Executors
    then load balance among their workers, process the task, and then
    the executor will send an ACK back to the context. At this point,
    the context waits for N ACKS and returns the dataset.
